## Steps

These are the incremental steps required to get this project to work

1. Click an object with the touch controllers
2. Click an object and have another object get rendered
   Look at the minecraft demo on Aframe
3. Have code auto generate objects
4. Grab and move an object
5. Create a "threshold" to trigger an event
6. Auto position the user based on the code
7. ... more than I can think of at the moment.
