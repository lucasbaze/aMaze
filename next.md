## Next Steps for the maze

1. Set the walls to a particular material
2. Add lighting to darken the entire space
3. Add creepy sounds
4. Have a level start (Could use the touchbad floor to start the timer)
5. Remove the floor when the game has been started
6. Have a game win event

## Ideas

4. Add a monster that roams the walls
5. Add a counter down timer to figuring your way out of the maze
6. Touching the walls (instead of running into them currently) marks where you've been
7. Generate "levels" of increasing difficulty
8. Add a countdown clock in the middle of the maze that is always facing the player ominously
